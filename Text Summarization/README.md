## Text Summarization
> *Text Summarization is important task of natural language processing that deals with extracting useful text that can summarize from huge chunk text by preserving original meaning, irrespective of its size*.<br>

Text Sumarization is of two types :<br>
**Extractive Summarization** - *Here important sentences are identified from original text and only that much are been extracted. We will use this approach in this repository.*<br>
**Abstractive Summarization** - *This approach determines to generate new sentences from original text but sometimes may seem to be incorrect grammatically or may also change actual meaning.*
