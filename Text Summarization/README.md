## Text Summarization
> *Text Summarization is important task of natural language processing that deals with extracting useful text that can summarize from huge chunk text preserving its meaning irrespective of size*.

Text Sumarization is of two types :
**Extractive Summarization** - *Here important sentences are identified from original text and only that much are been extracted. We will use this approach in this repository.*
**Abstractive Summarization** - *This approach determines to generate new sentences from original text but sometimes may seem to be incorrect grammatically or may also change actual meaning.*
